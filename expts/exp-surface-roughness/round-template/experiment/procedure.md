#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

#### Effect of layer height on surface roughness. :

1. When you open effect of layer height on surface roughness experiment, a window will open as shown. After reading the objective and apparatus required,  move mouse pointer over the description to read and recall the basic terms. Then click the NEXT button on the bottom right corner. <br>
